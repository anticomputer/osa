osa.el is an Emacs Lisp to macOS Open Scripting Architecture bridge
(JavaScript / AppleScript) working on top of Apple Event descriptors
as provided by Emacs Mac port.

* Features
All of the necessary Apple Event types that are needed to write useful
scripts are supported for both packing and unpacking:

+ True is unpacked to T
+ False is unpacked to NIL
+ Boolean is unpacked to T or NIL
+ Long is unpacked from signed 32bit to Emacs Lisp integer
+ Null which is distinct from null type, is unpacked to keyword :null
+ Type is unpacked to either (:type :null), (:type :msng), (:type data)
+ Unicode text (UTF-16 BOM auto-detection)
+ List is unpacked to Emacs Lisp vector
+ Record is unpacked to an Emacs Lisp tagged alist: (:reco (k . v) ..)

Conversely for packing, except T and NIL are always packed to True and
False (never a Boolean type) and tagged (:list ..) is packed like a
vector.

Additional types may be implemented in future releases.

* Note
Does not work with official GNU Emacs for macOS (or emacsformacosx.com).
You need Yamamoto Mitsuharu's excellent [[https://bitbucket.org/mituharu/emacs-mac][Emacs Mac port]], which can also
be found in MacPorts and Homebrew, though cloning its repository and
building from source is highly recommended.
